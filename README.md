# Transfer Plex Ratings to Subsonic

This is a small python script that transfers user ratings from a Plex server to a Subsonic server.

This script has been tested with Python 3.9+ and requires python libraries [Plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi) and [Py-Sonic](https://github.com/crustymonkey/py-sonic). Tested with Plexapi 4.13.2 and Py-Sonic 0.7.9.

These are the user configurable settings that you'll need to adjust to match your setup and preferences:
